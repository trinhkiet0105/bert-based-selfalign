"Hey, guess what Im doing tonight.","Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so","So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh."

"That proposal, at the planetarium","Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.","Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"

"Nope, got it and I got yours  too.","Oh, Ill get it.","That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!"
"Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face.",And in about five seconds youre gonna see why.,"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this."
"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the",Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.,He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani.,"Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
"I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job.",Here you go. Thank you!,Toby dont.
"Although, I might need some convincing.",What?,"Please, I'm not going for anything."
"Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.","Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.",I'm still alive!!
"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.",Yeah!,"Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!"
"LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back!","Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?","Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"

"I will, I will find him.",Ten dollars an hour.,"Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now."
Do you guys know any cute guys?,What is it?,"Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
"Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go",Okay.,Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Whats the charity?,"Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.","Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"""
"I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot.",Hello Greg?,There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?,"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.","Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here."
"Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?",Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head."
What are you guys doing later?,"Oh well, no harm, no foul.","Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
"Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.","Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is","Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?"
I want to see what he wants first.,"Oh, I know.  Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda",That would be no.
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.,"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.",I think it means he freaked out and left!
"Thanks for having me over, you guys.",I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,What?! Well he never said that to me!

Okay.,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",Oh! Oh!
Ityknow what?,"Hi, how are you doing Kelly?","I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends?"

"""Baddest man in the whole damn town.""","Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.","Uh, this is too weird."
Hi.,"No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.","There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.","Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?","Oh, did you catch him?!"
Okay.,"""Baddest man in the whole damn town.""","Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!"
"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it?",Whats going on?,"Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework."

Okay.,Celebrate.,"Oh, come on!"
Okay.,"Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again?","Oh my God, Phoebe,"

"So it's kinda like, you're, you know.","Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?","Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
You said...,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",Im an idiot.
I said ',But... ehm...,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
"I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?","Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night","Oh, I cant watch this."

"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.","Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too.","That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!"
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.,"Rachel, how did this happen?",It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?","But,  youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.",Know your audience!
No. Have you seen David?,Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed.,What?
"No, no, he hasn't been around.","Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.","But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",This is disgusting!
Minsk. It's in Russia.,I cant say.,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
I know where Minsk is.,"No, no, he hasn't been around.","Please, I'm not going for anything."
"So when, when do you leave?",Okay?,My lighters in there!

Excuse me.,"No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.",Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
Joey Tribbiani.,"No, it's been three nights in a row.","No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us."
The thing is its kinda on the Q.T.,"Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face.","Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!"
The actor who has the part doesnt know he might be fired.,Can we see her?,"Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now."
"Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.",Okay?,Uh-oh.
"Look, weve always talked about having babies someday.",Hi. Hi.,Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!

Were good.,"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.",Where?!
"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?","Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to.","Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it."
What did you say to him?,Okay.,No.
"Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.","Sure, whats up?","Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
"Oh yeah, sure.","Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.","Oh my God, who is it?!"

Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?,You know he's gay?,"Yeah, I guess it is."
How do,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!,No.,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.","No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.","Uh, this is too weird."
"How we doing, you guys ready?","Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.","Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,"Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so","No, but you're questioning my method!"
Some days it's all I can think about.,Okay.,Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",Umm?,"Because hell know what to do?  Oh my God, youre a genius!"
"Oh... ok, fine.","No-no, wait!","Uh, this is too weird."
But... ehm...,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.,"Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me."
"I just have one question for you,    ehm...",What about my questions?,I think it means he freaked out and left!
"When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...","Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.","Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
"Well umm, Alexandra has been",I said no.,This is totally your fault!
"Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell.","Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?","So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh."
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?,Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.,"Joey, uh-"
"No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.",And the nudity is really important to the story.,This is not going to work.
Which we can celebrate later.,"Eh, just a tad.",Yep! Grab a plate.
Celebrate.,"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
"Rachel, how did this happen?",Where are you Vic?,Oh just say it Kyle!
Where?,Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?,"The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!"
At his apartment. Is this juice?,"Well, why dont you just get him fired?","Uh, this is too weird."
It's breast milk.,"Okay, you guys free tonight?",I dont want a ghost.
So?,Yeah.,"Oh, let's not tell this story."
"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.","Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.",Ken Adams!!
You won't even taste it?,"No-no, wait!",Oh! Oh!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,"Hey, it's not like it sounds.","Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they?"
"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",I cant say because hes famous.,Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
How's the hair?,"I know, because youre not in that place.","Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me."
"I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.","Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.",Oh! Oh!
Can we see her?,I promise.,Chandlers gone again!
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",Wow!
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,Its not like its porn!,"Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though."
"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...","Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again?",Here!
Exactly.,Come on.,"Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she"
Uh huh.,"Oh, well... Maybe we could...","Please, I'm not going for anything."
"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.","Come on, come on.",How bad is this?
"Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either.","So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her.","Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it."
"Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.","I know, because youre not in that place.",Im an idiot.
Regina Philange.,Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?,"I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour."
Well maybe it was all of your questions.,"When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...","Oh, okay, I'm having another one!"
What about my questions?,"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.","Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
"No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.","Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so",As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
"Oh, Ill get it.",Okay.,"Please, I'm not going for anything."
Hello.,"Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me.",Okay!
Okay.,Okay.,Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
"No, no, thats the ghost for the attic.",You were with Julie?,"Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.","Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",I'm not reading this!
"Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government.",So where are we going next?,What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!
Hello.,"Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.",Im an idiot.
"Sure, whats up?","Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",Yep! Grab a plate.
Uh-huh.,But... ehm...,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",My first time with Carol was...,"No no no, believe me."
"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",How's the hair?,"The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!"
Okay. Its Emma.,"Oh no-no-no, Im there.","Oh, you've tasted it."
Take it.,"Yes, yes I do.","Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names."
What?,"Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night",I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Its clearly an Emma.,Well you can let me in later.,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!"
"Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing.","No, no, he hasn't been around.","Oh, you came on to Ross!"
"Look, Monica",Whats going on?,"Okay, yknow what? Can I, can I talk now?"
Hello Greg?,"Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant.",Emma!  See? I dont want it.
"Hi, this is Monica from the plane?","Yeah, me too.","Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars."
"Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?",Hey Bobby.,Im an idiot.
Say next Saturday?,Okay.,Jenny! That is so Jenny!

Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?
"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.",Have you seen Chandler?!,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Whats a Movement class?,"I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot.",What?
Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.,"Yeah, we werewe were just looking around.","Oh God, kindergarten flashback."

"Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor.","Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?","Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation."
"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?","When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...",I dont want a ghost.

Yeah.,"Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe","Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,"Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big",Hey!
Eh?,Whats the charity?,Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
"All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.","No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.","Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
"I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.",I do know.,Shell drive us totally crazy.
"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.",Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.,Oh! Oh!

"Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",Julie.,Really? You think so?
"No-no, wait!",Why not?,I know!
"This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.",The,You used the Europe story!

"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.","Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here.","We are good, interesting, funny people with"

Bob!,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.","So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So,What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!,"Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
Were so sorry.,"Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today.","Uh, what?"

"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.",Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.,"Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way."
"Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.",Im sorry.,"Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
"I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!","I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....",Know your audience!
