If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,"Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys."
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,Oh what then? Kick me?,Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.

"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!","Hey-hey, yknow what?","Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"

Do you always have to bring him here?,Chandler!,"Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."
Nobody sees the king!,Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!,"See, here’s  the thing."
Its not a real game! I made it up!,What about me?! You-you just said I could!,"I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!"

Okay?,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?","Oh, I know."
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",Theyre not true?
It's not funny!,"Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,"Now, hold on!",You'd better act surprised.
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.,What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.,"Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?"
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,"Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!",My wifes a lesbian.

"Monica, you dont even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!",Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!,"I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun."
Shut up! This place is a hole!,"He's totally ok with seeing you!"".",Really? That's great!
"Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.","All right, Im leaving!","Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous and, its just that I like you a lot, so..."
"Uh, de-clawing cats.","I mean its pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.","Oh yes, its me! Sorry!"
Well stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.,"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!","Oh, you have been through so much."
"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!",You said I was boring--Ohh!,"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section"
"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!","Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.","I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever."
"Okay, you go!","Thats right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, youre not a real doctor! And that womans brain, is fine!","I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.","Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",Okay. Let's do it again.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.,"Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!","Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?"
I don't know! I didn't come with her!,"""Pheebs, cant make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy.""  Big Daddy?","Umm, its Cutie McPretty."
"Hey, I've been honing!","You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.","Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",My God! What did you order?!
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!,"I'm like the bing, bing, bing.",Ugh!

You think you know me so well.,"Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!","I go to bed last night, everythings cool!"
"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my",Get out!!,Bwah-hah-hah!
"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?","All right, I'm outta here!","Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",Me too.,Yeah!
How'd you get to that?,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,"Yeah, its not mine."
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.,Are all the questions this personal?
"Aw, I know all about Kip!",Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean."
"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!,It doesnt say that in the script.,Let's try scooching!
Really?,Down at the docks again?,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
You are asking me to be your wife!,"Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!","Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!"

"All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!","Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.","Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?"
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,Lets go big bunny!,"Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house."
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!,Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.,What?
What do I have to do to get some service?!,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
Go!,Dont you look at her you sick bastard!,I want him to have his uncle.
"I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.","Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!","I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!"
Well theres some people who do want to marry me.,"I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!...","Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this."

Look at you. All jealous.,"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.","What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!"
"Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.",What about me?! You-you just said I could!,"No, I can spot you from here."
"Ross, no! There is",Oh great! That,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
"Ross, I am a human doodle!!","Okay, I cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!","No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him."
Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
We are switching at the next rest stop and,Here!,"Actually, thats our three hole punch."
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,Just being friendly.,No no no!
Sing!!,"Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!","Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?","Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...",I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
I can handle the stick!!,Are you looking at her?!,"No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!"
"Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!","Fine, yknow what, thats it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!","Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.","Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
You had no relationship!!,I'm not jealous.,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",Because Im not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.,Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
"Oh God, stop with the plan!","Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!","Tell me about it, huh?  Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica!  Ewwuck!"
Who cares?!,What did you say?,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
That doesn't mean anything!,I mean we should get free stuff too!,"Looks good, uh?"
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,"Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!",Hey-hey.
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!","Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since."
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!,Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.,Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??","Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free",Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?,"On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.","I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?",: No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done."
"No you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.","Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the worlds worst hangover! Ross, listen, if",Wanna play strip poker for practice?
"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.",Gimme the this!,"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this."

"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.","Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.","...No, we hate him."

Apparently youre not very good at it!,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",You're one to talk.
I dont need you guys to care about me!,"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.","Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
"No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!","No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.","Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert."
Ross! Janice?!,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!",Are you being British?!
He obviously went crazy.,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?,"Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
He obviously lost his mind.,So if you can help me find my Father then you should!,What?
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,Well then well get wet.,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
Damnit Phoebe!!,"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",That sucks!

But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.","Okay, get ready to owe me!"
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.",Is that a secret or a lie.,"Just, y'know out."
"A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",So what are you saying? Its now or never?,"Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",I did,"Yeah, listen..."
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!","I said, ""No!""","Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",Get out!,"Umm look, youre coming on a little strong."

Are you kidding me?!,"But I told you, I didnt have the time!","I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific."
It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?,"Oh, I cant believe this!"
I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!","Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."

"All right, let's try one.",in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.  Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.,Oh my God.
"Hmm, noodle soup.",So where-where is it going?,I'm free! I'm free!
Okay. Let's do it again.,"Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.","In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
Okay.,I dont think I should say.,Hey!
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!,"Well,","Oh, I dont know."
Yeah?,"Look, you and I went to different high schools...",And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Give her some money.,Hi.,"Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
I really think theyre out of rooms.,Hi.,"Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out."
"Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.",Yeah!,We have no choice!
Okay.,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.,"Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
"Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?",What?,"Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called."
This is a hospital.,Take my hand.,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Yknow what?,I mean.,"Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?"
Would you like to see a semi-private room?,Maybe?,Really.
"Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.","Yeah, yknow the license plate game?",This-this happened when my grandfather died.
"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",Which puts,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.","Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.","When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple."
If you wanna put a label on it.,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?","And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?"
"Okay, quick and painful.","Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.","Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"
Y'know Marcel?,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,"No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!"
...Yeah?,They have the best stuff in there.,Its-its too soon.
How are ya?,"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.",Hi!
Good.,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.","Dad, please dont pick your teeth out here!"
"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?","Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.",What are you crazy?!
Yeah.,Well then we still have a problem.,"Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?"
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?,"Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?","No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careI-I love Rachel."
Its not here.,"Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.",He does not look happy.
"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?",Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?,"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
How could I have left them in the copy room?,"Come on, they're close.",Let her know I like her?
This will be your phone.,"Uh, like, could these margaritas",He's like a big disgusting...
"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.","Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.","Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me."
No you answer it and take pledges.,Rachel didn't you just light that?,DANGER
"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.",But we should take it.,Why?
"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",Like it would help.,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
"Well, here's your phone doctor.","Hey guys, what are you doing?","Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there."
Hey guys.,"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.",What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
"Well, hes very charming.","Yeah, okay, Scott!",Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
"Well, youre just gonna have to try.","Monica, you go to the head of the class.","Chandler, I…"
"Joey, where are the",Well then we still have a problem.,Yes!
"I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em around...",Wanna peek?,"A small puff of air, now come on!"
"Yeah, you like that dont you?","Okay, what do you guys think?","Well, the old lady died."
Huh?,"Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.","Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
I talk to you and its nothin.,Your parents?,I like a girl with a strong jaw.
"You look at me, and nothin.",Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?,"Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing."
Nothing.,You cant,"Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!"
"Well, that was ah...","If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?","I mean, what the hell is that thing?"
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?",Really?
No. We were in the middle of sexand,"All right, I have one question.",Yay!!
"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.","And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.","A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?"
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.,Its pretty clear.,"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
"Oh, it's not!","Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?",Ohh thats nice.
It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.,"Well, that me.  Here, have this.  Im only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.",You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.,Nah. I kept myself busy.,You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
"I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.","All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.","All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong."
Thank you.,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Ill be out in a second.,Theyve been taping those people up there all day.,"Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party."
"Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.",Maybe.,...pig...pig man!
in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.  Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.,Well you can have the suite if you want.,"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
"Okay honey, you can finish this later were gonna be late. We gotta go.","Come on, do it.",And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!

"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.",And who laminated it?,"So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?"
Or an uncle...,"Oh, good. Thanks.",Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
"Phoebe, what's the matter?",Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,Were here to celebrate our love together.
"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.","No. But its okay, Ill just put out pickles or something.",Uh-oh.
Fine.,Wait!  Okay!,Im the ruptured spleen.
"Phoebe, what is it?","Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!",Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
"All right, you know Paolo?",Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
"I'm familiar with his work, yes...",I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there,They loved me!
Hey.,Then keep running.,"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
"Yeah,  oh, but oh...","They are not breaking up, look at them.","What are you, insane?"

Destiny.,Coming.,"No, no ""How you doing?"" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!"
Sure.,"I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.",God. Do think it really doesnt hurt? Cause how can they do that?
Yes.,"Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.",No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
All right.,"Okay, well then how about a handshake?","Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!"
"Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.","All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.","By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review."
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.,Why else would I be here?,"Well, thats not something a girl wants to hear."
"Well, they go into the chipper.",I guess.,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Light still out?,"No, I really did forget my purse.",I did not mean to touch thatI mean
Yeah.,"Hello?  No she cant come to the phone right now.  Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.",Well you should be embarrassed.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.,That's,Okay.
"So, whaddya think George is like?",Thanks Rach.,"Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this."
I think he's shy.,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....,"Ma, youre asking me to marry you?"
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.,"Ohh, okay.",What's with her?
Arent you with that girl over there?,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.,"Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like"
"Well, yeah, kinda.",At least you know her name.,Uh-oh.
"Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.","Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",You love her!
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...,Dime.,Oh yeah?
"Yeah, for you. Is that the list?","I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?","Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus."
"Um, yeah.","Yeah, listen...","Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
May I see it?,"Good evening, sir.",Got me.
"But, okay.","Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.","Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
"Um, see, but thats not the final draft.",Hi.,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.","Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?","Y'know, for me anyway."
Y'know its ironic...,"Thats right, you just enjoy.","I mean, I love-I love this little guy!"
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.,"Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this.",You do?
Were just gonna be friends.,"So, are you ready to go?",I like her. She sees smart.
"Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.","Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.",Yeah!
We have one.,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?","Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im"
"Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?","All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.",But they're not here yet!
"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!","That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",Janice
"Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?","So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?","Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
So thats the only reason she could be here huh?,"Oh, is the play over?","Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.","Well,fall out of it."
"I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.","I mean, why should I let them meet him?","Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
Good-bye.,"Yes, hi.",And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
"Uh, that was your sister actually.","Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.","I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
She-she thinks that youre just using me.,"No-no, Kathy.",I'm Joan Collins.
So?,"Dad, that wont matter to her.","Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",Hey.,"Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods."
"Umm, okay, okay, look.",Hi.,Oh my god.
"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.","Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.","Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast."
"No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!",I hope its you.,"Okay, I dont know what to do anymore."
"But umm, youre right.",No.,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
I think that a person should know where they come from.,"Ah, oh, hang on a second.  Come in, come in.  All right, so think about it, and call me back.",Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
"Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.",Youre right.,Im sorry. Im so sorry.
Im your mother.,Yknow what?,This is our wedding Im talking about.
Im from Long Island.,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
"So, if we could just get back to the lecture.","No, he's gone.",Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
"Umm, were there any questions?",I can blow dry it.,You sound like a guy.
About paleontology.,"Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father.",Its so hard!
But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.,"Yeah I can, it worked real well.",Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression,"I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.","Oh, was it awful?"
"Where you going, Joe?",Ill be there.,Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
For a walk.,"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?","No, I-Im saying I liked her."
Oh. You mind if I join you?,Ross.,"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.",Your son.,"Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.","Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.",You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?,"And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...",That almost hit me in the face.
"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.","Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.",So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
Fine ... mediocre porn,Ill call you back.,"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around."
"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.","So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.","Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
"Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",Oh.. oh... oh.,"Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?"
"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,",But,I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?",So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?,Me too!
"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.",And an assistant.,"Sure, now Im scared."
"Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.","Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.","Joey, what are you doing?"
"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?",Im 33.,You freak.
"Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?",Are you okay?,"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.,Thats what I do now.,"Joey,  where did you learn that word?"
You are iron.,Hey.,"But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
"I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?","Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.",Im such a jerk.
"Look, you and I went to different high schools...","Hey, I didnt make up the rules.","Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
"Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.","Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.","And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice"
"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.",Joey stuffing 15,There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,"Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind."
I-I owe her this.,"Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.","Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!"
I never let her eat.,Okay!,Oh! You got it?!
"Oh, you go out with him.",Okay.,Pheebs?
"Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?",How do you feel?,Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.
Ill try.,So thats the only reason she could be here huh?,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.","It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?",Nah!
"Yeah, yeah, okay.",Uh-huh.,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know",Can I ask you somethin'?,I cant live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
"Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.","Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?",In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
And Joey?,Nothing.,"Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too."
How do you think she's doing?,Drum roll.,"You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman."
Now that Rachel's gone?,Whats a scrud?,"Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through."
"Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.","Oh, that's attractive.","I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
"Hey, uh-hey, why dont we get some shoes on ya, huh?",Okay.,"All right, Im leaving!"
"Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things.",Yeah?,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
For fun?,Oh but you could.,"Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?"
"Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.","Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.",Kinda... spooky without any lights.
"Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?",No.,"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before."
"Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.","Okay, quick and painful.","Look, Im talking right now! Youreyou mean her."
So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?,"But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.",Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
"Rachel, I made you a cocoa.","Oh, yeah.",Yeah?
Hi.,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.",No no no!
All those things I said about not being ready,Smell familiar?,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
"No, theyre-theyre all true.","All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.","Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
But,"All right, that Ill retract.","Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party."
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?,Thank you.,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Yeah.,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.",That I was not expecting.
Okay.  Every time.,Hey.,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him."
"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",Hey.,Huh?
The balloon?,I bet its fast.,Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached",You didnt just break up.,No way!
"I can't, I gotta go.",Okay.,She keeps lying to me!
Got the keys?,"Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.",Oh God.
Ok.,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?",Hey!
What d'you think?,"Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate.",Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Lot of things.,She lives so close.,"No, no!"
Which one do you think she is?,Night Mon. Night Julio.,"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
May I help you?,"And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.","Obviously, I screwed up."
"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.","Yknow, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at","The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?"
You don't observe a dance class. You,Ill take a card.,No that could kill her.
What does she mean?,"No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.",Oh.
I think she means  'You,November 16,Because its weird!
She could be you.,"And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...",Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
"Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...","Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.",Oh my god. You are pure evil.
"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.","Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.",I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.","Oh, you want something serious.",I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
"Nooo, it wasn't.","Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.",I don't care if you    are my brother.
I know,Yeah.,You bug me.
"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.","OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",What?!
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,Awww.  But still no.,"Oh no, youll have to come."
"Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.","Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.",Not smoking.
"Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.",I know.  I need more pie.,Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.,Destiny.,"Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!"
"Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study.","You should ah, you should just leave it.",Thats great. Good for you guys.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.,I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

"That's alright, I'll take it.",You got me.,"No, no, no, its flattery."

"Yeah, because I was","Hello, this is Monica...",Oh not again!

"Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""","Whats the matter, Pheebs?",Not 700 exactly?
Well do you want some help?,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!

"But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed.",Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us.,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?","Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?",You know? Forget it!

You know where I work!,"Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady.","Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?"
I do?,But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.,We hate that guy.

"Yeah, its not mine.",He doesn't have anyone.,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
"Yeah, its  mine.","Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.",Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
I bet its fast.,"So ah, Monica ready yet?","Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it."
"Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?",I cant figure out what to make Monica.,ThatIts not the same thing! This is
Sorry.,No.,A date?!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?,Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,"No, no-n-n-n-no!!"

You mean this.,"Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.",No that could kill her.
"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!",You bet.  Maybe some other time?,Look confident.
"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.","Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.","But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help."
Okay.,Here.,"Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else."

How good is that?,"Okay, Ill be out in a second.","Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks."

Im just doing it to get back at Ross.,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.","Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?"
"Im sorry, its not very fair to you.",We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,"Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?"
"Fair, shmair","Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.","They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!"

Stupid balls are in the way.,Chris says theyre closing down the bar.,He told me in person.
"Oh, Ross youre right, I dont know why I always thought this was real grass.","Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.","I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
My wifes a lesbian.,"Seriously, how can you watch this?",Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
"Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.","I mean, what am I gonna do without you?",What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
No...,"Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,"Oh, I'm sorry.","No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont"
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!","Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",Chandler please!
"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",What? Im just said.,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap."
"Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...","I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.",I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...

"Joey, why is your cable out?","Oh please, they're having sex.","Ooh, now you lost me."
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill","Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
"Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.",Does it still hurt?,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still"
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",Shoot! Were out of soda.,"Well, John McClane had plans!"
"Ross, it's too hard.",Bob!,Yeah?
"Ohh, God.","Looks good, uh?","Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
"Looks good, uh?",Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,"Come on Phoebe, look at that!"
Well uh if you must know Im a widower.,"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",Morning!
Oh thats terrible. Im-Im really sorry.,"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.",Joe?
Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.,"Please, promise me that youll tell her that.","Oh sure, go with the sissy."
"Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.",Carol our sex life isits just not working,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out."
"Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!",Were probably too old to do that now.,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
"All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!",But I made cards!!,Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
"So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a",Did I use that already today? Im sorry.,Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!","Please, promise me that youll tell her that.","Phoebe, where's your purse?"
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,Yeah.
Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.","Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!"
Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.,"All right, Im-Im not English.","Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house."
This is hard.,"Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.",Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
"Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.","Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.","Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
"Yeah, but I didnt get to see it.",Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,Do you have any respect for your body?
"Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt.",Noo.,Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.","I said, ""No!"""
Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!","Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
Im sorry daddy.,Uh Phoebe?,"Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot."
"Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.","Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!","Well, not playing raquetball!"
"Look, is there something wrong with me?","It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.",I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?,Its so hard!,"This doesnt mean anything, does it?"
"Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!","Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.","Ahh, to be 13 again."
"I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?","I just, I feel, I-I just...",Uh-oh.
Im so-so sorry about yesterday.,"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.",Hey!
I-Im really sorry.,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,"Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love."
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.","Well, can you blame her?",Youre good. Youre good!
"And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.","No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.","Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
"Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.","No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.",Just smile and dont talk to
"Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?","Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",Nobody respects the bucket!
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.,Here!
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.","All right, Im-Im not English.","Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again."
Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!,Ohh. And I dont even have a date.,Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",That's not a trip!
"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.",Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.,look both ways before you cross the street.
You would've liked it.,"Looks good, uh?",You're one to talk.
I cant seem to say goodbye.,"In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.",No!
"No, because youre not a grandmother!",It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.","And I do, I have to make","Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman."
Sorry. Wrong boobies.,You would've liked it.,Its got em!
"Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",Chris says theyre closing down the bar.,Now go!
"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",Then how come it is?,"Thank you.  Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?"
"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.","And I do, I have to make",Kristen.
We ruined everything.,I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!,What?
Ugh,You can’t marry him!,"Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget."
"Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!",The babys coming and I dont know what to do.,Thats a little more than I wanted to see.
Surprise,"Yep. Yep, thats what I didnt want to know.","I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.","Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you.","I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.,You missed youre chance!,"Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand."
"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!,"Not him, you dont!"
"Ohh, thats too bad!",I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.,Wow that was a big one.
Okay well thats good to know.,"No! Really, no, please, please, thats, thats okay.","Okay, heres batch 22."
"All right, all right, you're right",We’re not peeking?,"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!"
"Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",Did I use that already today? Im sorry.,No!
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.","Look, I just lost my other job.","I mean, you know, we've never really talked."
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,"Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.","Phoebe, woo!"
"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.",Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!,Excellent.
Oh my God! Oh my God!!,"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.","Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
"I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",Oh God.,"Okay, dont worry. Youre ready."
"Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?","Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.",Okay?
"Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.","Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger.","Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?"
"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.",Were probably too old to do that now.,Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
"Your good heart Rach,  and, and....","Oh my god, we killed Bob!",Well it's not flexed right now!
"I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.",No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,You got porn!
"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.","No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.",I'm not jealous.
"God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.","Umm, she kissed me.","Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!"
"Its just changed, everything.",No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!,"Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come."
Forever.,All the time?,Why?
"Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.","Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.","Aww, look at the little thing."
Then how come it is?,"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a",All I really needed was a plan.
"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.","It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.","Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?"
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
"Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.","Im sorry, I do that.","No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou"
Uh Phoebe?,Oh come on!!,Is someone there?
"And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.","Ross, it's too hard.","Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before."
"And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.",Then how come it is?,Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
"Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry.",You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,"Oh, its incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."

"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.","Dont worry, Im brave!","Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor."
"So, what happens to the old guys?",I-I wasnt in that.,"And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night."
"Oh please, they're having sex.","Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.","Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?"

"And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.","I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.","No, no-n-n-n-no!!"
Oh.,Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys."
"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...",Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.,"That, that's what's stupid."
"All right, Im-Im not English.","Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.",Right- where we've been looking all night!
"I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.","And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.",Uhh… I think I just got engaged.

Thats kinda sad.,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom.""",Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.,"In that, um, they don't.","Yeah, this was a stupid idea."
Yeah but,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,"Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",We have so much in common!
"Oh, god help us.",I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?","I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!

Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,"Well, can you blame her?","You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
"Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?","Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",Uh-huh.
Sorry.,"Barry, I'm sorry...","Yeah, they're not so bad."
"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.","I know honey, Im sorry.",Take a couple deep breaths.

Oh God!,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom.""","Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!"
Here we go again.,"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.","Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
Is it something Im putting out there?,"Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost.",Theres nothing to handle.
Is this my fault?,Okay well thats good to know.,You. Like you havent done enough.

"Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.","It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.",Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
"Forget that British chippy.""",Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.,"Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
No!,"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",Do you have any respect for your body?

I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom.""","Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
And you really think this is a good idea?,"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.","Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,Ehh?
"Oh, that is so unfortunate.","Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",What are you doing?
"I know honey, Im sorry.","Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.","Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.",Thanks.,And that theyre going to be drinking alot!
"Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....","We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.","Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."

We can't. We're not pharmacists!,"Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.","Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt."
"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.","All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.","Umm look, youre coming on a little strong."
"No. No, you're not a loser.",I am so sorry...,Umm?
"Oh, be-because of the leather pants.","Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",Oh.
"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.","Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.","Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"

Oh God.,"She knows, and she wont tell me.","Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you."
No!,"Oh, I hate this story.","Oh no, youll have to come."

Sorry.,"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",Oh!
Sorry. Sorry.,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.","Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week.",I just didnt see the fast song coming.
I have never known love like this.,You still love me?,"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,"
All the time?,What?!,What?
Were probably too old to do that now.,Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available"

"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?",I dont think this numbers right!,"Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say."
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.","And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?","No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"

This is the worst Christmas ever.,What?!,What's this?
Terry already hired that girl over there.,"No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.","OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
